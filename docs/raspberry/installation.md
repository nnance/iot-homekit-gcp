# Raspberry PI Installation

The [Respberry PI](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BLRSKBV/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is a kit that comes an SD CARD with NOOBS preinstalled.  It's important to follow the instructions for assembling the container and installing the SD CARD.

## First Boot

1. Plug in your keyboard and monitor cables.  If you have a mouse it is slightly easier to complete the installation but it isn't required.
2. Now plug the USB power cable into your Pi.
3. Your Raspberry Pi will boot, and a window will appear with a list of different operating systems that you can install. We recommend that you use Raspbian â€“ tick the box next to Raspbian and click on Install.
4. Raspbian will then run through its installation process. Note that this can take a while.
5. When the install process has completed, the Raspberry Pi configuration menu (raspi-config) will load. Here you are able to set the time and date for your region, enable a Raspberry Pi camera board, or even create users. You can exit this menu by using **Tab** on your keyboard to move to `Finish`.
